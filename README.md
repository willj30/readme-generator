  ## Description
  I created this project to allow for users to create their own README for their projects within the command line using node js by answering simple prompts. This makes it easier to build a basic README for projects.

  ## Installation
  The user will need to download the inquirer package using the npm install command in node js. 
  
  ## Usage
  Once the required dependencies are installed, open the integrated terminal and run the "node index.js" command. This will display prompts and the README file will be created after answering all of them.
